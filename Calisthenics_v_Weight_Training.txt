Calisthenics vs. Weighlifting, which is better?
- where does boxing fit isn

Jumping right into the debate, both are forms of strength training.

First let's define some terms.

Calisthenics is an exercise philosophy that focuses on using your body weight to build strength and flexibility.

Don't be thrown off by the fancy word Calisthenics.  There's nothing really fancy about it.  You've definitely performed some sort of Calisthenics in your life without really knowing it since the activity is primarily pushing, pulling, lifting, and lunging movement with little or no equipment.  Military training is based on calisthenic exercises -- and contemporary fitness brands such as Cross


Weight Lifting is a fitness speciality primarily defined by performing movements against an opposing mass.  In other words, lifting, pulling, or pushing heavy things.  Since the mid-1970s, weightlifting has become the default philosphy when seeking to build muscle strength and size.  Larger than life embassadors for the discipline like Arnold Schwartzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and Jean Claude Van Damme paved the way during the 1980's for weight-lifting to take center stage.

So which training style would win in a boxing match?

First, let's beging with Training Flexibility, specificall the obstacles that may prevent you from getting started or my get in the way of keeping a steady routine.

Body building popularized the now default Split Training schedule: Back, Bis; Chest, Tris; Legs... etc... modularizes everything but doesn't help all of them move together... most movements in physical reality isn't split up this way... usually we will need to pick somthing up to move it... run in burst... dig a hole.




Boxers have been practitioners of Calisthenics from the beginning.

Calisthenics has seen a resergence as of late, especially with the closing of gyms obliging folks to improvise and search for home exercises that can provide the same results as the equipment found at the gyms

Eliot Hulse... Bench Press isn't really a Chest muscle builder... because it uses a lot of Triceps and shoulder.

Corss fit is a bit of a blend of Weighlifting and aerobic conditioning and use a lot of Calisthenics movements - but really a lot on weights and olympic style lifts

The military have designed compound Calisthenic movements that blend aerobic and anaerobic fitness (Navy Seals Burpee, Body Builder Burpee)
Question of Popularity of Weighlifting vs Functional training... 

Weighlifting is great if you want to become great at picking things up and putting them down... but what about picking things up... walking up the stairs.... opening the door... turning a corner... rotating the item... then Weighlifting quickly becomes one dimensional


cross fit has the right idea... so we'd recommend ... Calisthenics supersetted with endurance exercises
