Calisthenics vs. Weighlifting, which is better?
- where does boxing fit isn

Jumping right into the debate, both are forms of strength training.

First let's define some terms.

Calisthenics is an exercise philosophy that focuses on using your body weight to build strength and flexibility.

Don't be thrown off by the fancy word Calisthenics.  There's nothing really fancy about it.  You've definitely performed some sort of Calisthenics in your life without really knowing it since the activity is primarily pushing, pulling, lifting, and lunging movement with little or no equipment.  Military training is based on calisthenic exercises -- and contemporary fitness brands such as Cross-fit are based on calisthenic movements.


Weight Lifting is a fitness speciality primarily defined by performing movements against an opposing mass.  In other words, lifting, pulling, or pushing heavy things.  Since the mid-1970s, weightlifting has become the default philosphy when seeking to build muscle strength and size.  Larger than life embassadors for the discipline like Arnold Schwartzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and Jean Claude Van Damme paved the way during the 1980's for weight-lifting to take center stage.

So which training style would win in a boxing match?

First, let's beging with Training Flexibility, specificall the obstacles that may prevent you from getting started or my get in the way of keeping a steady routine.

Getting started with calisthenics is easy.  On your way to the refriderator, stop, from your hips begin to sit back keep your weight over your knees, don't let your knees pass your toes and sitdown on an invisible chair. Boom... your doing squats.  Or drop to to the floor chest down and push your yourself up... your doing pushups.  Turn over on your back and start doing leg-lifts or situps... then pop up on your feet and grab the top of the trim in the door way keeping your arms shoulder width apart and focus on pulling your elbows to your ribs.  Bam... you just got a full-body calisthenics workout in.

Getting started with weightlifting is easy too.  Invest in a good set of dumbbells, Google some workout routines for the muscle groups you want to isolate and get to reppin'. However, don't expect to get mind-blowing results from lifting these types of weights at home.  Building body mass using weight training requires a deeper knowledge of exercises routines and movements randing from compound to isolation.  There is a recovery time factor that plays a significant role.  You'll need to know when its time to train each muscle or else your gains will take too long to show.

Secondly, let's look at Endurance.  Calisthenic workouts are broader in application than traditional weight lifting.  Calisthenics is more than just working a muscle to exhaustion; its about exercising to build core and strength.

Take a simple example that people underestimate.  Grab a pullup bar and simply hang.  I bet dollars to donuts that even the most seasoned weightlifter who's done thousand of forearm curls won't last 20 seconds.  Add an L-sit to that hang, where you bring your legs up to the height of your hips, keeping your legs straight and the person will be in a world of despair.  The dead-hang, the plank, and other exercises that require you to hold your position without moving are often much more challenging than lifting weights.  These types of training methods increase physical endurance.  Endurance can be defined exerting strenthed for prolonged period of time.  Repeat the exercise, or rather hold the position, for two minutes and you've got a more effective workout in terms of endurance than you would have by lifting weights.  Endurance excerices were the favored training styles of some of the most pound-for-pound strongest and most fittest athletes... most notably Bruce Lee. He lifted some weights in terms of squats, deadlifts, and arm curls... but his routine with these movements emphasizes endurance over 1-rep maxes*.

Thirdly, Functional Strength 

Strength has always been associated with the bulding pecs and traps popping out of the Gold's Gym tank top.  We see biceps and automatically we assume that person has the elite level gym membership.  but calisthenics has something to say about strength as well.

Traditional weight training works wonders in strengthening certain muscle groups. Calisthenics works wonders in strengtening your complete body by helping you develop physical coordination and movement control.  Take the Burpee for example.  Its a squat, it's a pushup, and it's a back extension (and it can be a jump) -- all in one fluid motion.  The slow twitch muscles that get called in order to balance the transition from one motion to the next are a whole set of underlying neuromuscular conditioning that is absent in weight lifting.  It takes balance.  By involving your whole body in the movement, calisthenics engages the motor reflexes of the brain , which ultimately boost functional strength.  Weight lifting, on the other hand, is a controlled movement that has a lower impact on your motor reflexes.

However, weights do a more efficient job at boosting your force / explosiveness.  

take the burpee for example

Body building popularized the now default Split Training schedule: Back, Bis; Chest, Tris; Legs... etc... modularizes everything but doesn't help all of them move together... most movements in physical reality isn't split up this way... usually we will need to pick somthing up to move it... run in burst... dig a hole.




Boxers have been practitioners of Calisthenics from the beginning.

Calisthenics has seen a resergence as of late, especially with the closing of gyms obliging folks to improvise and search for home exercises that can provide the same results as the equipment found at the gyms

Eliot Hulse... Bench Press isn't really a Chest muscle builder... because it uses a lot of Triceps and shoulder.

Corss fit is a bit of a blend of Weighlifting and aerobic conditioning and use a lot of Calisthenics movements - but really a lot on weights and olympic style lifts

The military have designed compound Calisthenic movements that blend aerobic and anaerobic fitness (Navy Seals Burpee, Body Builder Burpee)
Question of Popularity of Weighlifting vs Functional training... 

Weighlifting is great if you want to become great at picking things up and putting them down... but what about picking things up... walking up the stairs.... opening the door... turning a corner... rotating the item... then Weighlifting quickly becomes one dimensional


cross fit has the right idea... so we'd recommend ... Calisthenics supersetted with endurance exercises
